# TBT

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.1241518.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1241518)

This EEGLAB plugin allows for the automatic rejection and interpolation of channels on an epoch-by-epoch basis.

It also comes with an additional method for rejecting epochs - max-minus-min threshold.

## Downloading

- You can download TBT through EEGLAB's data-processing extension GUI (_File > Manage EEGLAB Extensions > Data-Processing Extensions_).
- Or as a `.zip` file from EEGLABS's servers [(TBT v1.5)](http://sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab/plugins/TBT1.5.zip).
- Or as a `.zip` file from the GitHub page [(TBT)](https://github.com/mattansb/TBT/releases).

## List of included functions
- `eegplugin_TBT` - EEGLAB plugin function.
- `tbt_bcr` - epoch-by-epoch channel interpolation, based on any rejection method used by EEGLAB, or a manual cell-array listing which channels to interpolate in which epochs.
- `tbt_bool2cell` - converts a bollian channel-by-trial matrix to a tbt ready cell-list (see bellow).
- `tbt_cell2bool` - converts a tbt ready cell-list a bollian channel-by-trial matrix (see bellow).
- `pop_TBT` - call from EEGLAB menu of `tbt_bcr`. If no parameters are specified, pops a GUI window.

## TBT GUI

Use the menu.....

Or, by typing into the command line:

```matlab
[EEG, com, badlist] = pop_TBT(EEG); % pop-up interactive window mode

```

![pop_TBT](doc/TBT_eg.png)

You will be asked to....

## Scripting

Scrippting gives two major additional not avialble in the gui:

1. Supplying a cell-list for rejection
2. intrpolating addiotnal missing channels (thus making TBT an optiomal last step in pre-processing)

```matlab
EEG = pop_TBT(EEG,bads,badsegs,badchans,plot_bads,chanlocs);
% to get more info, type 'help pop_TBT' in the command line.

```

### Supplyinh manual cell list....

also mix with any rejection method by using tbt_cell2...

### Intepolating missing channels
